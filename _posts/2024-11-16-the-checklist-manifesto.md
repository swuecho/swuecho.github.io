**the checklist manifesto**
===========================

Yesterday, I was called on to do an demo of the feature I developed.

Before demo the feature, I have to do some preparation. I tried several times. The result is not what I expected.

Fortunately, it does not affect my demo.

After the demo, I checked the what I did wrong based on the document I wrote days ago.

It turns out, in the preparation, I did is correct. But I confused it with another procedure.

At this moment, I think of the book I read before " **the checklist manifesto**" **.**

The lesson is:

1.  find the correct procedure
    
2.  write down it step by step as a manual
    
3.  wherever, you do it, follow the manual.
