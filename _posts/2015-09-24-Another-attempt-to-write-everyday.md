Once in a while, I remember the habit I was taught in high school. My teacher was trying to train us to write something everyday.

I indeed, sometime, realize it is important and regret I did not follow. This situation reappear over and over again.

So, this is another attempt to try to form the habit.


I live with a Chinese family. They have friends and sometimes we picnic together. During the talk with them, I realize how important it is the environment.  The environment determine so much about what you do and without you, the body, notice it.

In order to be in a better environment, you have to be a better self.
