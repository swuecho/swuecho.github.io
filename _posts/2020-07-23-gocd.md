# install server and agent

follow the doc in official website.

PS: java is required.


# config agent


# config docker-compose

```
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
sudo usermod -aG docker go # give go-agent permisson to docker 
```

# create pipeline

quite easy following the quickstart guide.  the `custom command` argment should be option per line and no extra space is allowed.
