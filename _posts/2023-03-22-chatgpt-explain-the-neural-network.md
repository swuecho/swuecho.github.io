### use y=ax+b as an example to explain neural network


Sure, I can explain the neural network using the equation y = ax + b.

Let's consider a simple example where we have input values and their corresponding output values as follows:

| Input (x)  | Output (y) |
|------------|------------|
| 1          | 3          |
| 2          | 5          |
| 3          | 7          |
| 4          | 9          |
| 5          | 11         |

Now let's assume that we want to train a neural network to predict the output value (y) for a given input value (x).

The neural network will consist of the following layers:

- Input Layer: This layer will have one node that represents the input value (x).
- Output Layer: This layer will have one node that represents the output value (y).

Let's assume that the neural network has two weights: w1 and w2, which are randomly initialized. The equation for the output value of the neural network can be written as:

y' = w1x + w2

The goal is to adjust the weights (w1 and w2) such that the predicted output values (y') are as close as possible to the actual output values (y).

To achieve this, we need to perform the backward pass or backpropagation. Backpropagation is an algorithm that allows us to update the weights in the neural network based on the error between the predicted and actual output values.

The steps involved in the backward pass are as follows:

1. Forward Pass: In the forward pass, we feed the input (x) to the neural network, and the network computes the predicted output (y') based on the current weights (w1 and w2).

For example, if we use x = 2, the output of the neural network would be:

y' = w1 * 2 + w2

2. Compute the Error: Once we have the predicted output (y'), we need to compute the error between the predicted output (y') and the actual output (y). We can use a cost function such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) to compute the error.

For example, if we use x = 2, the predicted output (y') is:

y' = w1 * 2 + w2

And the actual output (y) is:

y = 5

The error can be computed as:

error = (y' - y)^2

3. Compute the Gradient: The gradient is the rate of change of the error with respect to the weights (w1 and w2). We need to compute the partial derivatives of the error with respect to the weights.

For example, if we use x = 2, the partial derivative of the error with respect to w1 is:

d(error)/d(w1) = 2*(y' - y)*x

And the partial derivative of the error with respect to w2 is:

d(error)/d(w2) = 2*(y' - y)*1

4. Update the Weights: Once we have the gradient, we can update the weights using the following formula:

w_new = w_old - (learning_rate * gradient)

Where w_old is the old weight, learning_rate is a hyperparameter that controls the step size of the update, and the gradient is the partial derivatives computed in the previous step.

For example, if we use a learning rate of 0.1, the new weight for w1 would be:

w1_new = w1_old - (0.1 * d(error)/d(w1))

Similarly, the new weight for w2 would be:

w2_new = w2_old - (0.1 * d(error)/d(w2))

5. Repeat Steps 1-4: We need to repeat steps 1-4 for each input-output pair in the training data. This way the network learns the optimal weights that minimize the error across all the training data.

6. Validation: After training the model, we need to validate the performance on a new set of data. We can use the validation set to tune the hyperparameters, such as the learning rate and the number of hidden layers, to improve the model's performance.

That's it! This is a basic example of using a neural network with backpropagation to predict output values based on input values.


### Why "We need to compute the partial derivatives of the error with respect to the weights."


Good question! We need to compute the partial derivatives of the error with respect to the weights because this tells us how much the error will change if we make a small change to one of the weights. 

To see why this is important, let's consider the example of a neural network with only one weight. Assume that we have computed the output of the network for a given input, and that the error between the predicted output and the true output is large. Clearly, we would like to update the weight in such a way that the error decreases. 

Now, suppose we make a small change to the weight. How much will the error change? This is where the partial derivative comes in. By computing the partial derivative of the error with respect to the weight, we can estimate how much the error will change if we make a small change to the weight. 

To illustrate this, suppose that the partial derivative with respect to the weight is positive. This means that if we increase the weight by a small amount, the predicted output will increase, and therefore the error will also increase. Conversely, if we decrease the weight by a small amount, the predicted output will decrease, and therefore the error will decrease. 

Thus, to minimize the error, we need to update the weight in the opposite direction of the partial derivative (this is why the gradient update formula involves subtracting the partial derivative times a learning rate). By doing so, we can iteratively update the weight until the error is minimized. 

This is why computing the partial derivatives of the error with respect to the weights is such an important step in backpropagation, and in training neural networks more generally. It allows us to estimate how much the error will change in response to a change in the weights, and thus enables us to iteratively update the weights to minimize the error.
