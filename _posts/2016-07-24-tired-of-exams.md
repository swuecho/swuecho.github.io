I am on the OMCS program. My experience in Reinforcemeng Learning remind me of the situation I was in graduate school.
Before the exam, trying to review the material, but can not focus.

I was planing to go for a PhD in the future, but that is unlikely. It is waste of time and I no longer want to be in the 
aniety of exams.

I often feel why I make my life so hard.
