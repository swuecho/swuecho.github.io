Are you tired of writing boilerplate code for your Golang applications? Look no further than ChatGPT! ChatGPT is an AI-powered platform that can help generate code for you, minimizing the amount of time it takes to write a Golang application. In this guide, we'll go over the steps to create a Golang application with the help of ChatGPT.

## Step 1: Design Schema

The first step of any Golang application development process is designing a schema. A schema is a blueprint or plan that outlines the structure of your application's database. The schema specifies the data types, relationships, constraints, and other details to be implemented in the database.

## Step 2: Let GPT Generate CRUD Queries for SQLC Based on Schema

Once you have your schema in place, let ChatGPT generate CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) queries for SQLC based on the schema. SQLC is a Golang library that allows developers to generate type-safe, composable SQL queries from plain SQL. With SQLC, developers can focus on writing code to handle the responses instead of wasting time writing SQL queries themselves.

## Step 3: Let GPT Generate Protobuf Definition

After generating CRUD queries for SQLC, ChatGPT will generate a protobuf definition for you. Protobuf, or Protocol Buffers, is a language-agnostic data exchange format that allows for faster and more efficient communication between systems. With the help of protobuf, data is encoded in a compact binary format, making it more efficient to store and transmit.

## Step 4: Let GPT Connect Query to Service

Finally, ChatGPT connects the generated queries to the service. This means that you can focus on writing the application's business logic, while ChatGPT handles the backend details. With ChatGPT, you can reduce the amount of time it takes to develop a Golang application without sacrificing code quality, speed, or scalability.

In conclusion, using ChatGPT to develop Golang applications can save you time and resources. All you have to do is design a schema, and ChatGPT takes care of the rest: generating CRUD queries for SQLC, a Protobuf definition, and connecting queries to the service. With these steps, you can develop applications faster and more efficiently, leaving you with more time to focus on what matters most - building a great product.
