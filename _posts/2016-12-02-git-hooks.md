Git hooks.

I finally decide to git hooks a try. 

My goal is  after I commit. run tests and email me the result.


I find a tutorial, think <code>post-update</code> is the way to go.

So I tried with the following code,  make some change and commit.
but it does not work.

```bash

#!/bin/sh
# send email
/usr/games/fortune | mail -s "git commited" email@gmail.com
```

As usual, I stackoverflow. some hints is that the GIT_DIR probably not right.

So I change it, still no lucky.

```bash

#!/bin/sh
# send email
GIT_DIR=/home/hwu/downstream/
/usr/games/fortune | mail -s "git commited" email@gmail.com
```

At this point, I am a bit angry, why it is so hard to complish such a simple thing?

There seems no easy matrials I can rely on.

Seems whatever I do, git post-update hook do nothing.


I wonder maybe the post-update hook is not the right one, when I find that most of the topic is about pull,
update when talking about post-update.

Finally, I switch to post-commit and it works. 

The Whole process take me about 1 hour. 

Once this works, I will add my code to do the test. That part shoud be easy
