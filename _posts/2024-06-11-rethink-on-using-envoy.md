I know envoy proxy because of gRPC-Web project, which use envoy proxy by default.

two point I do not think using envoy is a right choice:

1. incompatiple changes too offten and when it break, no clear message is given. just coredump
2. document is not clear a lot of time. ( have to google, do research and trail and error)

Mightbe next time, I should be cautious to choose new tech stack. If have to, only use the minimal feature set.
