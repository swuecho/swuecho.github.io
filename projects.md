I start to realize that things are fade away too fast. 

## Mine


<https://github.com/swuecho/chat>

chat web app for teams, sass with user management and ratelimit, support chatgpt(openai & azure), claude and ollama model

## Other's 


### Data:

<https://github.com/cube2222/octosql>
OctoSQL is a query tool that allows you to join, analyse and transform data from multiple databases and file formats using SQL.

Note: Multiple database sql join is very expensive. for medium or large table, it is not usable. However, I like the project to query json files using sql.


<https://github.com/chdb-io/chdb>

chDB is an embedded OLAP SQL Engine ðŸš€ powered by ClickHouse

Note: should be very handy to use in Jupter Notebook.

### Network

<https://github.com/lanthora/candy>

I use it to connect to home server.
